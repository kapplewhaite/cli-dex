# CLI Dex
A CLI program that pulls information from Pokémon in the Kanto Region (1-151)

## Concept
This program allows a user to search for a Pokémon (by either name or number) and pull information such as Evolution Information, Height, Weight, etc. All data is retrieved from PokéAPI (https://pokeapi.co/) (https://github.com/PokeAPI).

### Available Pokémon
Pokémon 1-151 (Bulbasaur - Mew) will have data available to be retrieved. Data will be up-to-date as of Generation 9 (Scarlet and Violet).

Name: {name} <br>
Dex #: {nat_dex_num} <br>
Abilities: {list_of_abilities} <br>
Types: {list_of_types} <br>
